OK, back to SQL Server.  Assume the following for a single UMS:  SPID 51 is currently running.  
The Runnable Queue consists of SPIDs 60, 55, 87 & 79.  The Waiter list includes SPIDS 55, 84 & 72.  
The Work queue is empty.  Now, assume the running SPID 51 needs physical IO.  
Two things will happen.  SPID 51 is moved to the wait list until the IO is completed and the next session_id 
in the runnable queue, SPID 60, begins to run.  When the IO is complete, SPID 51 is moved to the bottom of 
the runnable queue which now consists of SPIDS 55, 87, 79 & 51.

Given this scenario, the total amount of time waiting consists of resource and signal waits.  
The time waiting for a resource is shown as Resource Waits.  
The time waiting in the runnable queue for CPU is called Signal Waits.  
In SQL Server 2005, waits are shown in the Dynamic Management View (DMV) sys.dm_os_wait_stats.  
The query to measure cpu pressure is as follows:

---- Total waits are wait_time_ms
*/

Select signal_wait_time_ms=sum(signal_wait_time_ms)
          ,'%signal (cpu) waits' = cast(100.0 * sum(signal_wait_time_ms) / sum (wait_time_ms) as numeric(20,2))
          ,resource_wait_time_ms=sum(wait_time_ms - signal_wait_time_ms)
          ,'%resource waits'= cast(100.0 * sum(wait_time_ms - signal_wait_time_ms) / sum (wait_time_ms) as numeric(20,2))
