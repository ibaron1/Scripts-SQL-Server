
The problem with different collations between server and db is as is mention before that temp tables will default be created with the server collation. 
That will make any comparisons on character fields between a temp table and a regular table fail. 
This can be avoided by the developers of the 3rd-party apps by using COLLATE database_default for character fields of temp tables.

create table #Tmp(Col1 nvarchar(50) COLLATE database_default)
I come from the "other" side. I'm not a DBA but a 3rd party software developer and I think that it is my responsibility 
to build my app to work in an environment where the collation is different between database and server. 
It is also my responsibility that my app will work with case sensitive collation.
