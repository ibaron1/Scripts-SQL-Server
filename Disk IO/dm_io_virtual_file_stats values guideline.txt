What are good io_stall numbers from sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats?

I've seen some great queries posted here to look at the io_stall numbers using sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats.  
If I divide the stall ms by the read/write counts, I get a number that looks like ms/io. 
 Is that valid, I mean, should it look like the ms/read numbers one gets from perfmon?  If so, I'm in trouble!
So, in summary, what kind of numbers are good for io_stall / (num_of_read + num_of_writes)?
And yes, of course "it depends", but assume typical OLTP workload of small rows.  
But should the numbers be in the 10ms range, or 100ms because it actually includes some internal SQL time, or what?

IO Stalls are a sign of disk subsystem bottlenecks on the server.  The lower the better is the general rule of thumb for these.  
What is acceptible depends a lot on your SLA's and what associated wait types are being reported as the top waits in dm_os_wait_stats 
when you order by the wait_time_ms descending and remove the typical system based waits.
