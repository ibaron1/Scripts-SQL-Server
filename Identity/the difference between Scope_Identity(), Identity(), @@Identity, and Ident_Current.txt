The @@identity function returns the last identity created in the same session.

The scope_identity() function returns the last identity created in the same session and the same scope.

The ident_current(name) returns the last identity created for a specific table or view in any session.

The identity() function is not used to get an identity, it's used to create an identity in a select...into query.

The session is the database connection. The scope is the current query or the current stored procedure.

A situation where the scope_identity() and the @@identity functions differ, is if you have a trigger on the table.
 
If you have a query that inserts a record, causing the trigger to insert another record somewhere, 
the scope_identity() function will return the identity created by the query, while the @@identity function will return the identity created by the trigger.

So, normally you would use the scope_identity() function.
