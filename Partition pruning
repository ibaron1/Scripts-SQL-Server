Partition pruning is a performance optimization technique that analyzes query conditions to determine and eliminate unnecessary partitions from being scanned, improving data retrieval speed and reducing query costs. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
What it is:
Partition pruning is a mechanism used by database systems (like BigQuery, Oracle, TiDB, etc.) to optimize queries on partitioned tables. 
How it works:
When a table is partitioned, data is organized into multiple partitions based on a specific column or columns. 
Partition pruning analyzes the WHERE clause (or other filter conditions) of a query to identify which partitions are not needed to retrieve the requested data. 
The system then skips scanning these irrelevant partitions, significantly reducing the amount of data that needs to be read and processed. 
Benefits:
Faster Queries: By scanning only the necessary partitions, partition pruning can dramatically reduce query execution time. 
Reduced I/O: Less data needs to be read from storage, leading to lower I/O costs and improved resource utilization. 
Improved Cost Efficiency: Since less data is processed, the cost of running queries can be reduced. 
Types of Partition Pruning:
Static Partition Pruning: Occurs when the filter conditions in the WHERE clause are constant values, allowing the system to determine which partitions are irrelevant at query planning time. 
Dynamic Partition Pruning: Used when the filter conditions involve calculations or functions, requiring the system to collect information about partitions during query execution to determine which ones are needed. 
Examples:
If a table is partitioned by year and you query for data from 2023, partition pruning can skip scanning partitions for other years. 
In Snowflake, partition pruning is used to eliminate irrelevant micro-partitions based on filters applied in the query. 
Related Concepts:
Predicate Pushdown: A related optimization where filter conditions are pushed down to the data source (e.g., Parquet files) to reduce the amount of data that needs to be read.
